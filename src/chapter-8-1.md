Resilience can be defined as an individual's or organization's ability to withstand and bounce back from adversity. Problem-solving is a key component of resilience for several reasons:

The decision-making process is intrinsically linked to resilience, as it determines how individuals and organizations respond to adversity. Here's why effective decision-making is crucial for fostering resilience:
